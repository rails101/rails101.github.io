```
📝 As as app user, I want to create a new round, so that I can start the selection process.
```

We know that we create records through mutations and we've covered the topic before so this should be quick.

Let's generate our mutation.

`Terminal`

```bash
$ bin/rails g graphql:mutation_create Round
      create  app/graphql/mutations/round_create.rb
```

A mutation class named `Mutations::RoundCreate` is generated for us and a `round_create` field is added to `Types::MutationType`. We won't need to make any changes to `app/graphql/types/mutation_type.rb` so let's look at `app/graphql/mutations/round_create.rb`. We won't need `round_input` so we'll remove that. We've already got some generic error handling set up so we'll use `create!` again, instead of `save`. We're not anticipating any failures here anyway, but if it happens we'll catch it.

Let's make those changes.

`app/graphql/mutations/round_create.rb`

```ruby
module Mutations
  class RoundCreate < BaseMutation
    description "Creates a new round"

    field :round, Types::RoundType, null: false

    def resolve
      round = Round.create!
      { round: round }
    end
  end
end
```

Let's generate our tests.

`Terminal`

```bash
$ bin/rails g integration_test types/mutation_type/round_create
      invoke  test_unit
      create    test/integration/types/mutation_type/round_create_test.rb
```

Let's fill in the generated tests.

`test/integration/types/mutation_type/round_create_test.rb`

```ruby
require "test_helper"

class Types::MutationType::RoundCreateTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  setup do
    @query = <<~GRAPHQL
      mutation RoundCreate {
        roundCreate(input: {}) {
          round {
            id
            createdAt
            updatedAt
            selections {
              id
            }
          }
        }
      }
    GRAPHQL
  end

  test "round_create" do
    assert_difference -> { Round.count } do
      post graphql_path, params: { query: @query }

      round = Round.last

      assert_equal(
        {
          "data" => {
            "roundCreate" => {
              "round" => {
                "id" => round.id.to_s,
                "createdAt" => round.created_at.iso8601,
                "updatedAt" => round.updated_at.iso8601,
                "selections" => [],
              },
            },
          },
        },
        @response.parsed_body
      )
    end
  end
end
```

Let's run our new test.

`Terminal`

```bash
$ bin/rails t test/integration/types/mutation_type/round_create_test.rb
Running 1 tests in a single process (parallelization threshold is 50)
Run options: --seed 26820

# Running:

.

Finished in 0.149116s, 6.7062 runs/s, 13.4124 assertions/s.
1 runs, 2 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```

Let's also make sure we don't have any regressions by running all of our tests.

`Terminal` (output omitted)

```bash
$ bin/rails t
```

Success!
