For our "Engineering All Hands" meetings at Hipcamp, we have someone new run it every week. That person is picked at random using some manual process. Let's make a web app to do that for us. Make sure you have recent versions of [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) installed. Installation is outside the scope of this guide, but if you're on macOS you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to help with installation and versioning.

Check your versions.

`Terminal`

```bash
$ ruby -v
ruby 3.1.2p20 (2022-04-12 revision 4491bb740a) [x86_64-darwin21]
$ rails -v
Rails 7.0.3.1
$ postgres -V
postgres (PostgreSQL) 14.2
```

Create a new API only Rails application.

`Terminal` (output omitted)

```bash
$ rails new all_hands --database=postgresql --api
$ cd all_hands
$ g add .
$ g commit -m "Initial commit" -m "rails new all_hands --database=postgresql --api"
```

Start the server.

`Terminal` (output omitted)

```bash
$ bin/rails s
```

Let the server run and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

You should see a lot of red and probably something about the database. That's good. The application is running. We just need to run a few more commands. Every command from here on out will assume that you're in the root directory of the project.

If you see `ActiveRecord::ConnectionNotEstablished`, start the service.

`Terminal`

```bash
$ brew services start postgresql
==> Successfully started `postgresql` (label: homebrew.mxcl.postgresql)
```

If you see `ActiveRecord::NoDatabaseError`, create the database.

`Terminal`

```bash
$ bin/rails db:create
Created database 'all_hands_development'
Created database 'all_hands_test'
$ bin/rails db:migrate
```

Finally, refresh the page and you'll see a Rails welcome screen. In your project directory, you might notice a new file named `db/schema.rb`. Whenever we have uncommitted changes and seem to be at a good stopping point, you'll see a box like the one below.

```
âœ… Make a commit
